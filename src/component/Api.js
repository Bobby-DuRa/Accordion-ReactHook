        question: 'Can I turn my cat into a diamond?',
        answer:'Yes. It is scientifically possible to turn your beloved deceased pet or human relative into a diamond that you wear on your finger as a token of remembrance. In fact, there are companies that exist right now that are willing to do this for you. Diamonds that are created from the remains of a loved one are called "memorial diamonds."'

        question: 'How do I turn on more parts of my brain and get smarter?',
        answer:'Turning on more parts of your brain does not make you smarter. The brain does not really work that way. An example of a brain experiencing high activation is a seizure. During a seizure, a person has severely decreased functioning and mental capability. '

        question: ' Why are human brains the biggest?',
        answer:"The brains of humans are not the biggest compared to all other animals. The average human brain has a mass of about 1 kg. In contrast, the brain of a sperm whale has a mass of 8 kg and that of an elephant has a mass of 5 kg. You may be tempted to think that bigger brains means smarter and that because humans are the smartest animals, we must have the biggest brains. But biology does not work that way. When an animal has a larger overall size, all of its organs must be generally bigger just to keep it alive"

        question: 'Why cant color blind people see any colors?',
        answer:'Most people with color blindness can see almost all colors. They are typically only blind to a few colors. Furthermore, they are not completely blind to those colors, but are only partially blind. The human eye contains three types of color detecting cells: red-detecting cones, green-detecting cones, and blue-detecting cones. Each cone cell can detect many colors in addition to its main color.
